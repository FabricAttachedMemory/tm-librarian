Debian packaging for The Librarian File System (LFS) Suite

The "upstream" branch of this repo contains the source code and detailed
documentation.  This branch is meant to be combined with "upstream" to
create Debian packages.  In particular, a "debian/gbp.conf" exists to 
control some of the execution of gbp-buildpackage.

To make the packages python3-tm-librarian, tm-librarian, and tm-lfs:

1. Check for ~/.gbp.conf or ~/.devscripts as they may contain conflicting settings.
2. Insure there is no "master" branch
3. Start from the debian branch:

	$ git checkout debian --

4. Create a "master" branch from "debian":

	$ git checkout --orphan master

5. Merge the upstream branch:

	$ git merge upstream

6. Build the binary package(s) via

   	$ gbp buildpackage -b -us -uc -i

   Per "man gbp-buildpackages" the options are passed to debuild(1) The
   package files are in /tmp/gbp4hpe (as specified in debian/gbp.conf)

7. Clean up with

	$ git checkout debian -- && git branch -D master
