# Debian packaging for The Librarian File System (LFS) Suite

The "upstream" branch of this repo contains the source code and detailed
documentation.  This branch is meant to be combined with "upstream" to
create Debian packages.  In particular, a "debian/gbp.conf" exists to 
control the execution of gbp-buildpackage.

To make the packages python3-tm-librarian, tm-librarian, and tm-lfs:

1. Check for ~/.gbp.conf or ~/.devscripts as they may contain conflicting settings.
1. Insure there is no "master" branch
1. Checkout the debian branch via "git checkout debian --"
1. Create a "master" branch from "debian" via "git checkout --orphan master"
1. Merge the upstream branch
1. Build the binary package(s) via
   gbp-buildpackage -b -us -uc -i

   Note: the options are passed to debuild(1) which can also be used here:
1. The package files are in /tmp/gbp4hpe
1. Clean up with "git checkout debian -- && git branch -D master"
