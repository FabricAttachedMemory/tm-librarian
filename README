These are the NVM related components owned by the L4TM team.

    The delivery points are:

        - TMQ (put a bow around this and replace with QFE when ready)
        - Qemu Fabric Experience (Qemu, res2hot and libpregion replacement)
        - TMAS with GenZ/NVM and Top of Rack Server implemented
        - Real Hardware with GenZ/NVM and Top of Rack Server present

Style
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - run pep8 and pylint on code

JSON

    - field names

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node/Book registration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There will need to be a process for registering books with the Librarian.

A static file will be used to initialize the database when the Librarian
is brought up for the first time or in the case we want to support some
type of reinitialize operation.

The format of the data file will be (one stanza per node):

    { 
        "node_id":"INT"                     # node identifier where the books are hosted
        "num_books":"INT"                   # number of 8GB books hosted on the node
        "genz_addr":"INT"                   # GenZ address of the beginning of the first book
    }

Assumptions:

+ NVM on each node is a continiuous block with respect to GenZ addressing
+ Books are 8GB in length

Issues/Questions:

+ 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian packaging of Librarian
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The librarian and all supporting files/documentation should be delivered
in a Debian/hLinux package.

- which files
- where are they delivered

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identity Manager
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do we need to have some type of identity management function built into the Librarian
for the iterim, to convert node local user/group IDs into a global ID?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Librarian Issues/Questions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. How does the Librarian find out if a node goes down?

2. If a node goes down what does the Librarian do with any shelf reservations belonging to the node?

3. What happens if an NVDIMM board goes down?

Database schema
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"books" - All available books.

    book_id <INT>          - (primary key) unique ID, maybe the global GenZ address
    status <INT>           - some type of status (zero if unused, used, unavailable or in error?)
    shelf_handle <INT>     - shelf handle for the shelf this book belongs to, zero if free/unused
    sequence <INT>         - order in which this book was added to shelf (1..N) zero if unallocated
    attributes <INT>       - ??? maybe some type of attributes, such as proximity ???
    owner <INT>            - ??? maybe a owner ID to track who originally created this shelf ???

    Issues/Comments:

        + assuming a book can only be allocated to one shelf at time
    
"shelves" - All currently allocated shelves.

    shelf_id <INT>         - (primary key) unique ID of some type 
    size_bytes <INT>       - current size in bytes, zero if no books allocated
    book_count <INT>       - current number of books on shelf
    open_count <INT>       - current number of opens
    owner <INT>            - ??? maybe an owner ID to track who originally created this shelf ???
    creation_date <INT>    - ??? maybe a date stamp when this shelf was created ???

    Issues/Comments:

        + assuming a shelf can have many users that have it open
        + assuming it's important to track the order in which books where added to shelf, so books can be deleted in LIFO order

"shelf_reservations" - Holds all current shelf reservations.

    rowid <INT>            - (primary key)
    shelf_id <INT>         - unique ID of some type 
    open_id <INT>          - a unique identifier for who has this shelf open (NodeID+GUID+GGID) or process ID, ???
    date_reserved <INT>    - ??? maybe a date stamp when this shelf was reserved ???

    Issues/Comments:

        + assuming the "open_id" is unique

"firewall_managers" - All currently registered node firewall managers.

    node_id <INT>         - (primary key) unique ID of some type
    host <TEXT>           - hostname for socket communication

    date_registered <INT> - ??? maybe a date stamp when this firewall manager registered ???

    Issues/Comments:

        + assuming one firewall manager running on each node
        + assume firewall manager starts up and contacts Librarian with communication information
