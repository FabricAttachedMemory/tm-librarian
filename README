Debian packaging for The Librarian File System (LFS) Suite

The "upstream" branch of this repo contains the source code and detailed
documentation.  This "debian" branch is to be combined with "upstream" to
enable the creation of Debian packages.  In particular, a "debian/gbp.conf"
exists to control the execution of gbp-buildpackage.  Per "man gbp.conf"
it should override any system-wide or personal settings.

To make the binary packages python3-tm-librarian, tm-librarian, and tm-lfs:

1. Check for ~/.devscripts as it may contain conflicting settings, particularly
   the DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS variable.  "man debuild" has more info.
   Rename or remove the file if you are unsure of its interaction.

2. Start from the "debian" branch and insure there is no "master" branch:

	$ git checkout debian -- && git branch -D master

3. Create a fresh "master" branch from the current "debian":

	$ git checkout --orphan master

   This also switches to that new "master".

4. Merge the "upstream" branch into "master":

	$ git merge upstream

5. Build the binary package(s) via

   	$ gbp buildpackage

If it works, the package files are in /tmp/gbp4hpe (see debian/gbp.conf)
