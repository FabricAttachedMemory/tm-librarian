Debian packaging for The Librarian File System (LFS) Suite

The "upstream" branch of this repo contains the source code and detailed
documentation.  This "debian" branch is to be combined with "upstream" to
enable creation Debian packages.  In particular, a "debian/gbp.conf" exists
to control some of the execution of gbp-buildpackage.

To make the binary packages python3-tm-librarian, tm-librarian, and tm-lfs:

1. Check for ~/.gbp.conf or ~/.devscripts as they may contain conflicting settings.
2. Insure there is no "master" branch
3. Start from the debian branch:

	$ git checkout debian --

4. Create a "master" branch from "debian":

	$ git checkout --orphan master

5. Merge the upstream branch:

	$ git merge upstream

6. Build the binary package(s) via

   	$ gbp buildpackage

   The package files are in /tmp/gbp4hpe (as specified in debian/gbp.conf)

7. Clean up with

	$ git checkout debian -- && git branch -D master
